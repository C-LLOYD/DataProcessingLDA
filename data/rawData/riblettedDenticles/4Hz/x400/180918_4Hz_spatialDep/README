Description:
	LDA data collected for smooth plate at 4Hz pump frequency at 3 profile locations and for 200 sec sampling time (grid ~76 points).

    We investigate spatial dependency of profile collection over ~single denticle

	Temp change from 17.7 Deg to 17.9 Deg over last 3 hrs of sampling (assume av ~17.8)

	Water is 4 Days old so there are no bubbles on the plate (plate levelled using granite parallels). 

	Generally sample rate of < 20Hz consistently
