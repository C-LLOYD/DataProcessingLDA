Description:
	LDA data collected for smooth plate at 12Hz pump frequency at 3 profile locations and for 200 sec sampling time (grid ~76 points).

    We investigate spatial dependency of profile collection over ~single denticle

	Temp change from 18.2 Deg to 18.5 Deg over day of sampling

	Water is 5 Days old so there are no bubbles on the plate (plate levelled using granite parallels). 

	Generally sample rate of < 20Hz consistently
