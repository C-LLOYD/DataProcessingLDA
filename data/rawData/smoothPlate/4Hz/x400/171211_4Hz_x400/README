Description:
	LDA data collected for smooth plate at 4Hz pump frequency at x=400mm and for 2min sampling time (grid ~60 points).
	Purpose is to provide good time-resolved profile for data  comparisons to rough surfaces

	Temp change from 17.3 Deg to 17.4 Deg over 2 hours of sampling time

	Water is 3 Days old so there are no bubbles on the plate (Plate left in flume for full 3 days, water level untouched for that period). 

	Generally high sample rate of 300Hz consistently

	Water level stayed at ~ 0.5cm above marker

	Plate levelled to 0.4mm over 400mm length (0.057 Degrees)
