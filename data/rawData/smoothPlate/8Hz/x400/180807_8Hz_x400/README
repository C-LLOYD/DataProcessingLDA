Description:
	LDA data collected for smooth plate at 8Hz pump frequency at x=400mm and for 200 sec  sampling time (grid 73 points).
    
    These are final BL experiments for flat plate.

    Probe orientation 45 deg with 2.7 deg dipped beam

	Temp change from 20.5 Deg to 21 Deg over course of day 

	Water is 1 Days old so there are no bubbles on the plate  

	sample rate of ~15-20Hz max, seemingly clean data (lower than previous possilby due to beam alignment or better water quality)

	Water level constant but leak at back of flume - collected water periodically added back in

	Plate level only checked using spirit level and parallels
