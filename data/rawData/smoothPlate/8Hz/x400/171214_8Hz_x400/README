Description:
	LDA data collected for smooth plate at 8Hz pump frequency at x=400mm and for 2min sampling time (grid ~65 points).
	Purpose is to provide good time-resolved profile for data  comparisons to rough surfaces

	Temp change from 18.8 Deg to 19.1 Deg over 2 hours of sampling time

	Water is 7 Days old so there are no bubbles on the plate (Plate left in flume for full 7 days, water level untouched for that period). 

	Generally high sample rate of 300-400Hz consistently

	Water level stayed at ~ 0.5cm above marker

	Plate level not checked but plate not moved since 171211

	ISSUE:	after run, biofilm was found over the plate. Likely invalid data because of this.
