Description:
	LDA data collected for smooth plate at 8Hz pump frequency at x=400mm and for 2min sampling time (grid 73 points).
    
    Purpose is to do some quick tests in order to measure prelim differences between plates. These will be repeated in the future.

    Probe orientation 45 deg with 2.7 deg dipped beam

	Temp 17.7 Deg 

	Water is 6 Days old so there are no bubbles on the plate (Plate left in flume for full 6 days, water level untouched for that period). 

	sample rate of ~30Hz max, seemingly clean data

	Water level stayed at ~ 0.5cm above marker (consistent between )

	Plate level 0.3mm / 400mm = 0.04 deg slope (measured previous day but z finder in right location)
